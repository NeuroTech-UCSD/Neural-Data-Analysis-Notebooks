# Neural-Data-Analysis-Notebooks
Notebooks for NeuroTech at UCSD interactive workshops working with neural data. 

The data is from BCI Competition IV 2b, which consists of 2-class Motor Imagery (imagine left vs right hand movement) recorded on 3 scalp electrodes and 3 electrodes around the face for eye / face movements. 

Data adapted from http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/ <br>
